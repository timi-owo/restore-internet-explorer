## What's it to do?
- Bring back **"Internet Explorer"** for latest version of Win10 and Win11. It means you can use the **"Internet Explorer"** as a standalone browser like before, no annoying **"Microsoft Edge"** startup again.
- Restore the castrated **"Internet Options"** in the **"Control Panel"**.
- Provide a registry file for completely remove **"IEToEdge BHO"** (It actually no needed, but if you want).
